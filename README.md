# Linear-SVM-from-scratch- Pytorch
Linear SVM using CVXOPT4 Python package

Implemented Linear SVM from scratch without using any libraries like scikit-learn, instead used CVXOPT4 Python package to solve quadratic programs.
In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier. An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible.

Although, there are libraries that are available yo make use of this functionality, it is good to know how one arrived there.

Enjoy Coding! :)
